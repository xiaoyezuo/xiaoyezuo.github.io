I hold a MSE in Robotics from UPenn and a BS in Computer Engineering (minor in Business) from UCSD.

I enjoy being dropped into envronments where I have to learn on the fly while building systems that work well in practice. I have done this at [Daxo](https://daxo-industries.com/), where I designed and implemented the image-based fruit detection pipeline for a prototype automatic picker, as well as designed the data flywheel for driving learning system improvement. I have done this in research, where I built a video dataset through text-video concept extraction for vision-langauge navigation (paper under review). I have done this for class projects, e.g. I implemented a proof-of-concept facial landmarker to do facial expression extraction for actors in motion-capture suits [TODO github](link.com).

I am fluent in English and Mandarin. This is particularly useful when working with Chinese hardware systems where no English documentation exists.
