I hold a MSE in Robotics from the University of Pennsylvania and a BS in Computer Engineering (minor in Business) from UC San Diego.

I enjoy being dropped into envronments where I have to learn on the fly while building systems that work well in practice. 
* I have done this at [Daxo](https://daxo-industries.com/), where I designed and implemented the image-based fruit detection pipeline for a prototype automatic picker, as well as designed the data flywheel for driving learning system improvement. 
* I have done this for class projects, e.g. I implemented a [facial landmark tracker](https://github.com/xiaoyezuo/facetrack) combining SOTA face detectors and TAPIR to solve the challenge of facial expression extraction for actors in motion-capture suits.
* I have done this in research, where I built a video dataset through text-video concept extraction for vision-langauge navigation based on the [RXR dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/RxR/tree/main) (paper under review). 

I am fluent in English and Mandarin. This is particularly useful when working with Chinese hardware systems where no English documentation exists.
