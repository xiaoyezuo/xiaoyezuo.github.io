<p>All living things are optimizing for the same global reward: survival. This is true by construction; those agents poorly optimized die and no longer exist, and those remaining are thus better optimized to survive. Reinforcement Learning as a paradigm essentializes this â€“ an agent takes a series of actions and then recieves a reward from the environment. Through experience, the agent seeks to maximize this reward</p>
