<p><em>Q:</em> Can we have autograder with public tests and private tests? That will be much more helpful!</p>
<p><em>A:</em> No. This is not 121. This is not 187. This is 220. You are expected to be able to write your own code and not just fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>One of the overarching goals of this class is for you to learn how to write programs in a real world environment.</p>
<p>In the real world, no one writes tests for you. If you do not meet the spec for the work assigned to you, you will be laid off and replaced with someone who can. Alternatively, your code may meet the spec’s interface but fail in production. The company will do a postmortem, and it will come out that you did not correctly test your code. You will be laid off and replaced with someone who can.</p>
<p>I’m not being hyperbolic. Writing correct, self-tested code to a spec is a required real world skill, and one which we are trying to teach you here. We would much rather you get dinged a few points on an assignment now than be unemployable in 3 years.</p>
<p>We will not give you an autograder, nor public tests. It’s explicitly your job to write them yourself.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
