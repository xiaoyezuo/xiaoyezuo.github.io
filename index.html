I’m Xiaoye Zuo 左晓晔
</h1>
<p><img class="centered" src="img/profile_pic.jpg" height="400" /></p>
<p>I hold a MSE in Robotics from UPenn and a BS in Computer Engineering (minor in Business) from UCSD.</p>
<p>I enjoy being dropped into envronments where I have to learn on the fly while building systems that work well in practice. I have done this at <a href="https://daxo-industries.com/">Daxo</a>, where I designed and implemented the image-based fruit detection pipeline for a prototype automatic picker, as well as designed the data flywheel for driving learning system improvement. I have done this in research, where I built a video dataset through text-video concept extraction for vision-langauge navigation (paper under review). I have done this for class projects, e.g. I implemented a proof-of-concept facial landmarker to do facial expression extraction for actors in motion-capture suits <a href="link.com">TODO github</a>.</p>
<p>I am fluent in English and Mandarin. This is particularly useful when working with Chinese hardware systems where no English documentation exists.</p>
