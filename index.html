I’m Xiaoye Zuo 左晓晔
</h1>
<p><img class="centered" src="img/profile_pic.jpg" height="400" /></p>
<p>I hold a MSE in Robotics from the University of Pennsylvania and a BS in Computer Engineering (minor in Business) from UC San Diego.</p>
<p>I enjoy being dropped into envronments where I have to learn on the fly while building systems that work well in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have done this at <a href="https://daxo-industries.com/">Daxo</a>, where I designed and implemented the image-based fruit detection pipeline for a prototype automatic picker, as well as designed the data flywheel for driving learning system improvement.</li>
<li>I have done this for class projects, e.g. I implemented a <a href="https://github.com/xiaoyezuo/facetrack">facial landmark tracker</a> combining SOTA face detectors and TAPIR to solve the challenge of facial expression extraction for actors in motion-capture suits.</li>
<li>I have done this in research, where I built a video dataset through text-video concept extraction for vision-langauge navigation based on the <a href="https://github.com/google-research-datasets/RxR/tree/main">RXR dataset</a> (paper under review).</li>
</ul>
<p>I am fluent in English and Mandarin. This is particularly useful when working with Chinese hardware systems where no English documentation exists.</p>
