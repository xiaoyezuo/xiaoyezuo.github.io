#### Abstract

We present the Windowed Anytime Multiagent Planning Framework (WAMPF), a framework that can make *any* optimal MAPF solver anytime by exploiting domain sparsity. Real-world domains are often sparse, i.e. agent-agent collisions tend to involve a small subset of agents in a single local region; this allows WAMPF to break down a large MAPF problem into small repair windows that can be efficiently searched to quickly generate a *valid* path. As time permits, WAMPF repair windows are grown and further repaired to improve the global repair quality. WAMPF provides online path suboptimality upperbounds, provably converges to a known optimal path given sufficient runtime, and provides infrastructure for information reuse to speed up window repair searches if supported by the underlying MAPF planner.

We present two A\*-based implementations of WAMPF: 1) Naive Windowing A\* (NWA\*), a naive implementation that does not leverage information reuse, and 2) Expanding A\* (X\*), an efficient implementation that employs a novel A* search tree transformation to perform search reuse.
    
Experimentally, we demonstrate that in sparse domains: 1) X\* outperforms state-of-the-art anytime or optimal MAPF solvers in time to valid path, 2) X\* is competitive with state-of-the-art anytime or optimal MAPF solvers in time to optimal path, 3) X\* quickly converges to tight suboptimality bounds, and 4) X\* is competitive with state-of-the-art suboptimal  MAPF solvers in time to valid path for small numbers of agents while providing much higher quality paths.
